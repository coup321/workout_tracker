# Introduction

StatLifts is a data analysis pipeline that I developed in order to facilitate data science mediated optimization of my training. In my searches of apps and services, I could not find a resource that offered the following:<br>
- Outstandingly simple input on my phone in the gym.
- Easy access to graphs and tables in a clear and interpretable format for in the moment decision making regarding training decisions.

I eventually discovered that I could record my workouts in a simple fashion using google spreadsheets in the following format:<br>

This simply left the data pipeline to be developed in the way that I wanted. 

These notebooks are the result of my efforts.
